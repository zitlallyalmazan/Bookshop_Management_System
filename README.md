# Overview

I will be creating a Bookshop Management System program using C++ that will demonstrate one or more of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, or data structure from STL. This project will use two programs for the Owner and Customer.

The Owner Panel will:
* Add a new book
* Search a book
* Modify an existing book
* View books which are less than five in stock
* Built in login system (Only Owner can access)

The Customer Panel will:
* Search book (by name, author name, id, category, etc.)
* Request for a new book

The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker. My C++ will include the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.
